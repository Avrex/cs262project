To compile:
==========

To run tests:
============
Tests require JUnit installed. To compile and run the JUnit tests, execute:
    $ make test

Dependencies:
============
* MongoDB (http://www.mongodb.org/)
* Apache Tomcat (http://tomcat.apache.org/)

To run the services:
===================
0. Place the hostnames of all replicas into the config/services.config file, and
in WebContent/WEB-INF/lib/config/services.config. 

1. Start the rmi registry:

     $ rmiregistry &

2. Launch the appropropriate service. The update flag forces the rmi registry to
bind the name of the service to this current running instance.

     $ ./GradeStorageService [--update]

3. Copy the WebContent directory to the Apache Tomcat webapps/ directory.

4. Copy the compiled project directory classes/ into webapps/WebContent/WEB-INF

Note: For persistent storage services, also start the MongoDB instance.
